# MediPulse - MVP Specification for Enterprise AI Solution

## 1. Introduction

MediPulse is an agentic AI workflow designed to automate the extraction of structured data from medical documents. This document outlines the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) specification for evolving MediPulse from a prototype into a robust, enterprise-ready solution for healthcare providers, payers, and researchers.

The goal of the MVP is to deliver a secure, reliable, and user-friendly platform that addresses the most critical pain points in medical data extraction, providing immediate value and a strong foundation for future enhancements.

## 2. Target Audience & Pain Points

The MVP will focus on the following user personas:

| Persona | Role | Pain Points |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Brenda** | Medical Biller/Coder | - Time-consuming manual data extraction for coding and billing<br>- High risk of errors leading to claim denials<br>- Inconsistent document formats |
| **Dr. Chen** | Clinician | - Administrative burden of manual data entry into EHRs<br>- Difficulty finding specific patient information quickly<br>- Contributes to clinician burnout |
| **David** | Clinical Researcher | - Manual and error-prone data transcription for studies<br>- Data heterogeneity from multiple sources<br>- Slow data collection process |

## 3. Core MVP Features

### 3.1. Document Processing & AI Extraction

- **Secure Document Upload:** A web-based interface for users to upload medical documents in various formats (PDF, JPEG, PNG).
- **Pre-defined Extraction Models:** Pre-trained AI models for extracting key information from:
    - **Patient Intake Forms:** Demographics, insurance details, medical history.
    - **Lab Reports:** Key lab values, reference ranges, patient identifiers.
    - **Prescriptions:** Medication names, dosages, physician information.
- **OCR for Scanned Documents:** Utilize Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to process scanned and image-based documents.

### 3.2. Human-in-the-Loop Verification

- **Verification Interface:** A user-friendly, side-by-side view of the original document and the extracted data.
- **Data Validation & Correction:** Allow users to easily validate, correct, or add missing information.
- **Confidence Scores:** Display confidence scores for each extracted field to guide the verification process.

### 3.3. Data Export & Integration

- **Structured Data Export:** Export verified data in standard formats like CSV and JSON.
- **API Access (Phase 1):** A secure RESTful API for programmatic access to the extraction service, allowing integration with other systems.

### 3.4. Security & Compliance

- **HIPAA Compliance:** The platform will be designed to be HIPAA compliant from the ground up.
- **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login with role-based access control (RBAC).
- **Data Encryption:** End-to-end encryption for data at rest and in transit.
- **Audit Trails:** Comprehensive logging of all user and system activities for compliance and security monitoring.

## 4. Technical Specifications

| Component | Technology/Approach |
| :--- | :--- |
| **AI/ML Core** | - **LangGraph** for agentic workflow orchestration<br>- **OpenAI GPT-4o** for vision and language processing<br>- **Pydantic** for schema definition and validation |
| **Backend** | - **Python (FastAPI)** for building a scalable and secure RESTful API<br>- **PostgreSQL** for storing user data, document metadata, and audit logs |
| **Frontend** | - **React/Next.js** for a modern, responsive, and user-friendly web interface |
| **Infrastructure** | - **Docker** for containerization<br>- **Cloud Provider (AWS/GCP/Azure)** for scalable and secure deployment<br>- **CI/CD Pipeline** using GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment |
| **Security** | - **OAuth 2.0 / JWT** for authentication<br>- **TLS/SSL** for data in transit encryption<br>- **AES-256** for data at rest encryption |

## 5. Success Metrics

The success of the MVP will be measured by:

- **Extraction Accuracy:** Achieve >95% accuracy for high-confidence extractions.
- **Time Saved:** Reduce the average time to process a document by at least 50% compared to manual workflows.
- **User Adoption:** Onboard at least three pilot customers within the first quarter post-launch.
- **User Satisfaction:** Achieve a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of >40 from early adopters.
- **System Performance:** Maintain an API response time of <3 seconds for single-document processing.

## 6. Roadmap Beyond MVP

- **Batch Processing:** Allow users to upload and process multiple documents in a single batch.
- **Expanded Document Support:** Add support for more complex documents like discharge summaries, operative reports, and clinical notes.
- **EHR Integration:** Develop integrations with major Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems (e.g., Epic, Cerner).
- **FHIR Compliance:** Ensure that the extracted data can be mapped to the FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard.
- **On-Premise Deployment:** Offer an on-premise deployment option for large enterprise clients with strict data residency requirements.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Provide dashboards and reports on document processing trends, data accuracy, and user productivity.
- **Custom Model Training:** Allow users to train custom extraction models for their specific document types and workflows.
