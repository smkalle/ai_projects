# Key CoA Concepts to Preserve in Karpathy-Style Refactor

## Core Technical Achievements
1. **55.3% on GAIA benchmark** (vs 53.2% WebSailor)
2. **47.9% on LiveCodeBench** (vs 42.4% Reveal-32B)
3. **18-20% improvement from RL** (PPO optimization)
4. **Single inference pass** instead of multiple agent calls

## Essential Components to Keep

### 1. Multi-Agent to Single Model Distillation
- **Original**: Complex OAgents framework demonstration
- **Karpathy-style**: Build simple agents first, then show distillation
- **Preserve**: The core insight that multiple agents can become one model

### 2. Trajectory Generation & Recording
- **Original**: Abstract Trajectory dataclass
- **Karpathy-style**: Start with list of tuples, evolve to dataclass
- **Preserve**: The concept of recording agent interaction chains

### 3. Progressive Filtering Pipeline
- **Original**: Complex filtering algorithms
- **Karpathy-style**: Simple quality checks first, then sophisticated
- **Preserve**: Why filtering matters for training quality

### 4. SFT Implementation
- **Original**: HuggingFace Trainer abstraction
- **Karpathy-style**: Raw PyTorch training loop first
- **Preserve**: How trajectories become training data

### 5. PPO/RL Optimization
- **Original**: Full PPO implementation
- **Karpathy-style**: Simplest reward optimization first
- **Preserve**: The 18-20% gain mechanism

## What Makes CoA Special (Must Emphasize)

1. **Cost Reduction**: One API call instead of many
2. **Speed Improvement**: Single pass inference
3. **Performance Gains**: Beats multi-agent systems
4. **Learned Collaboration**: Not prompted, but trained
5. **Production Ready**: Real deployment examples

## Comparison Points to Maintain

### Traditional Multi-Agent:
```python
# Slow, expensive, complex orchestration
response1 = llm_call("Agent 1: ...")
response2 = llm_call("Agent 2: " + response1)
response3 = llm_call("Agent 3: " + response2)
```

### CoA Approach:
```python
# Fast, cheap, single model
response = afm_model(prompt)  # Contains all agent behaviors!
```
