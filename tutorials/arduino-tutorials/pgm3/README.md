# Program 3: Analog Input with Potentiometer

## Overview
This program introduces analog input by reading values from a potentiometer (variable resistor) and using those values to control LED brightness. It demonstrates analog-to-digital conversion and PWM output.

## Components Required
- Arduino Uno
- 1x Potentiometer (10kΩ recommended)
- 1x LED
- 1x 220Ω resistor
- Breadboard
- 5x Jumper wires

## Wiring Instructions

### Potentiometer Connection:
1. **Identify legs**: Most pots have 3 legs in a row
2. **Power connections**:
   - Left leg to Arduino 5V
   - Right leg to Arduino GND
   - Middle leg (wiper) to Arduino A0
3. **Note**: Outer legs can be swapped (just reverses direction)

### LED Connection:
1. **Use PWM pin**: Connect to pin 9 (PWM capable)
2. **Add resistor**: 220Ω between pin 9 and LED positive
3. **Ground**: LED negative to Arduino GND

## Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

### Hardware Setup:
1. **Potentiometer placement**:
   - Insert potentiometer on breadboard
   - Ensure all 3 legs are in different rows
   
2. **Wire the potentiometer**:
   - Connect outer legs to 5V and GND
   - Connect middle leg to A0
   
3. **LED setup**:
   - Place LED on breadboard
   - Add resistor to positive leg
   - Connect to pin 9 and GND

### Software Setup:
1. Open Arduino IDE
2. Connect Arduino via USB
3. Select correct board and port
4. Open `potentiometer_read.ino`

## How to Upload and Run

1. **Compile**: Click checkmark (✓)
2. **Upload**: Click arrow (→)
3. **Open Serial Monitor**: Tools → Serial Monitor
4. **Set baud rate**: 9600
5. **Turn potentiometer**: Watch values change!

## Understanding the Code

### Key Functions:
- **analogRead()**: Reads analog value (0-1023)
- **analogWrite()**: Outputs PWM signal (0-255)
- **map()**: Scales one range to another

### Analog vs Digital:
- **Digital**: Only HIGH (5V) or LOW (0V)
- **Analog Input**: Reads any voltage 0-5V as 0-1023
- **PWM Output**: Simulates analog using rapid on/off

### Value Conversions:
```
Potentiometer: 0V → 0, 5V → 1023
LED PWM: 0 → Off, 255 → Full brightness
Voltage = (ADC Value / 1023) × 5V
```

## Serial Monitor Output
```

Turn the potentiometer to see values change
----------------------------------------
Raw Value: 0    Voltage: 0.00V  LED Brightness: 0 (0%)
Raw Value: 512  Voltage: 2.50V  LED Brightness: 128 (50%)
Raw Value: 1023 Voltage: 5.00V  LED Brightness: 255 (100%)
```

## Troubleshooting

1. **No readings/always 0**:
   - Check A0 connection to middle pot leg
   - Verify 5V and GND connections
   - Try different analog pin

2. **Erratic readings**:
   - Check for loose connections
   - Add small capacitor (0.1µF) across pot
   - Ensure good breadboard contacts

3. **LED doesn't change brightness**:
   - Verify using PWM-capable pin (3,5,6,9,10,11)
   - Check LED orientation
   - Test with fixed analogWrite values

4. **Values jump around**:
   - Normal for ±1-2 units
   - Add averaging for stability
   - Check power supply stability

## Experiments to Try

1. **Reverse operation**: Swap 5V and GND on potentiometer

2. **Multiple LEDs**: Control several LEDs differently
   ```cpp
   analogWrite(LED1, ledBrightness);
   analogWrite(LED2, 255 - ledBrightness); // Inverse
   ```

3. **Threshold detection**: Turn LED on/off at specific values
   ```cpp
   if (potValue > 512) {
     digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH);
   }
   ```

4. **Smoothing**: Average multiple readings
   ```cpp
   int average = 0;
   for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
     average += analogRead(POT_PIN);
   }
   average = average / 10;
   ```

5. **Map to different ranges**: Control servo angle, motor speed, etc.

## Advanced Concepts
