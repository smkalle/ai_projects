```

## Physical Setup

### Knock Detection Surface:
1. **Mount piezo sensor**: Attach to a solid surface (door, box, or board)
2. **Secure connection**: Ensure piezo is firmly attached for good vibration transfer
3. **Protected wiring**: Keep sensor wires secure to prevent false readings
4. **Test surface**: Hard surfaces work better than soft materials

### LED Placement:
- **Red LED**: Position prominently to show locked status
- **Green LED**: Next to red LED for clear status indication
- **Visibility**: Ensure LEDs are visible from knocking position

## Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

### Hardware Setup:
1. **LCD first**: Connect display and test with contrast adjustment
2. **Piezo sensor**: Wire with 1MΩ resistor for proper sensitivity
3. **Status LEDs**: Connect red and green LEDs with resistors
4. **Audio feedback**: Connect buzzer for sound effects
5. **Program button**: Wire with internal pull-up enabled

### Software Setup:
1. Open Arduino IDE
2. Load `secret_knock_detector.ino`
3. Connect Arduino via USB
4. Select correct board and port
5. Upload the program

## How to Upload and Run

1. **Compile**: Click checkmark (✓) to verify code
2. **Upload**: Click arrow (→) to upload to Arduino
3. **Open Serial Monitor**: Set to 9600 baud
4. **Test knock**: Tap the sensor to test detection
5. **Learn pattern**: Default is long-short-long-short-long

## How It Works

### Normal Operation:
1. **System locked**: Red LED on, waiting for knock pattern
2. **First knock detected**: System enters listening mode
3. **Pattern recorded**: Each knock timing is stored
4. **Pattern analysis**: Compares detected pattern to secret
5. **Access decision**: Unlock if match, remain locked if not

### Pattern Matching Process:
1. **Timing measurement**: Records time between knocks
2. **Pattern comparison**: Checks each timing against secret
3. **Tolerance allowance**: Small timing variations accepted
4. **Length verification**: Pattern must have correct number of knocks

### Programming Mode:
1. **Press program button**: Both LEDs flash
2. **Knock new pattern**: System records your knocks
3. **Auto-save**: Pattern saved after 2 seconds of silence
4. **Exit programming**: Returns to locked state

### Security Features:
- **Failed attempt tracking**: Counts incorrect patterns
- **Lockout mode**: 10-second lockout after 3 failures
- **Auto-lock**: Returns to locked after 5 seconds
- **Manual override**: Program button for pattern reset

## Understanding the Code

### Key Programming Concepts:

#### State Machine Design:
```cpp
enum SystemState {
  LOCKED,
  LISTENING,
  PROGRAMMING,
  UNLOCKED,
  PATTERN_MATCH
};
```
**Why important**: Manages complex system behaviors cleanly

#### Pattern Storage:
```cpp
int secretPattern[MAX_KNOCKS];     // The secret knock pattern
int detectedPattern[MAX_KNOCKS];   // Currently detected pattern
```
**Why important**: Efficient array-based pattern storage

#### Knock Detection:
```cpp
int sensorValue = analogRead(PIEZO_PIN);
if (sensorValue > KNOCK_THRESHOLD) {
  // Knock detected!
}
```
**Why important**: Converts vibrations to digital signals

#### Pattern Comparison:
```cpp
for (int i = 1; i < secretPatternLength; i++) {
  int difference = abs(secretTiming - detectedTiming);
  if (difference > PATTERN_TOLERANCE) {
    return false;  // Pattern doesn't match
  }
}
```
**Why important**: Allows for human timing variations

## Troubleshooting

### Knock not detecting:
- Check piezo sensor connection and 1MΩ resistor
- Verify sensor is firmly attached to knocking surface
- Adjust `KNOCK_THRESHOLD` value if needed
- Test with Serial Monitor to see sensor values

### Pattern not matching:
- Increase `PATTERN_TOLERANCE` for more flexibility
- Practice consistent knock timing
- Check pattern length matches exactly
- Use Serial Monitor to debug timing values

### LCD not displaying:
- Adjust contrast potentiometer
- Verify all LCD connections
- Check power supply (5V and GND)
- Test with simple LCD example first

### False knock detection:
- Ensure stable mounting of piezo sensor
- Add shielding to sensor wires
- Increase `KNOCK_THRESHOLD` value
- Check for electrical interference

### System not unlocking:
- Verify correct pattern in Serial Monitor
- Check timing tolerances are reasonable
- Ensure pattern length matches
- Test with simpler patterns first

## Experiments to Try

### 1. Musical Knock Patterns:
```cpp
// Recognize rhythm patterns like "Shave and a Haircut"
int musicalPattern[] = {200, 200, 400, 200, 600, 400};
```

### 2. Multi-User System:
```cpp
struct User {
  int pattern[MAX_KNOCKS];
  int patternLength;
  String name;
};
User users[5];  // Support 5 different users
```

### 3. Pattern Strength Recognition:
```cpp
// Require specific knock strengths
int strengthPattern[MAX_KNOCKS];
if (abs(knockStrength - expectedStrength) < STRENGTH_TOLERANCE) {
  // Strength matches!
}
```

### 4. Two-Factor Authentication:
```cpp
// Require button press after correct knock
if (patternMatches && digitalRead(CONFIRM_BUTTON) == LOW) {
  grantAccess();
}
```

### 5. Learning Mode:
```cpp
// System learns user's typical timing variations
void adaptToUser() {
  for (int i = 0; i < patternLength; i++) {
    averageTimings[i] = (averageTimings[i] + detectedPattern[i]) / 2;
  }
}
```
