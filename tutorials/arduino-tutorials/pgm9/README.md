## Wiring Instructions

### HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor:
1. **VCC** → Arduino 5V
2. **GND** → Arduino GND
3. **Trig** → Arduino Pin 7
4. **Echo** → Arduino Pin 8

### Alert LED:
1. **Anode** (long leg) → Arduino Pin 13
2. **Cathode** (short leg) → 220Ω resistor → Arduino GND

### Buzzer (Optional):
1. **Positive** → Arduino Pin 6
2. **Negative** → Arduino GND

### LCD Display (Optional):
- Follow the wiring from Program 8 (LCD Display)
- Uses pins 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12

## Installation and Setup

1. **Install Arduino IDE**
   - Download from: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

2. **Connect Hardware**
   - Wire components as shown in circuit diagram
   - Ensure HC-SR04 has clear line of sight
   - Double-check all connections

3. **Upload Code**
   - Open `ultrasonic_distance.ino` in Arduino IDE
   - Select correct board and port
   - Upload code to Arduino

## Running the Program

1. **Power on** the Arduino
2. **Open Serial Monitor** (Ctrl+Shift+M, baud rate 9600)
3. **Position sensor** with clear front view
4. **Move objects** in front of sensor (2cm to 4m range)
5. **Observe**:
   - Serial output with distance and status
   - LED alerts when object is within 10cm
   - Buzzer sounds during proximity alert
   - LCD display (if connected)

## Expected Behavior

### Normal Operation:
- Continuously measures distance every 100ms
- Displays smoothed distance readings
- Shows status: TOO CLOSE, NEAR, MEDIUM, FAR, VERY FAR
- Updates both Serial Monitor and LCD

### Proximity Alert (< 10cm):
- LED turns on
- Buzzer sounds (1000Hz, 100ms pulses)
- LCD shows "!!" indicator
- Serial Monitor shows "ALERT!"

### Distance Ranges:
- **TOO CLOSE**: < 5cm
- **NEAR**: 5-20cm
- **MEDIUM**: 20-50cm
- **FAR**: 50-100cm
- **VERY FAR**: > 100cm

## Understanding the Code

### Key Functions:

#### `measureDistance()`:
- Sends 10µs trigger pulse
- Measures echo pulse duration
- Calculates distance using speed of sound
- Includes timeout and error handling

#### `smoothDistance()`:
- Implements moving average filter
- Reduces noise in readings
- Uses circular buffer for efficiency

#### `checkProximityAlert()`:
- Monitors distance threshold
- Controls LED and buzzer
- Updates visual indicators

### How Ultrasonic Sensors Work:
1. **Trigger pulse**: 10µs HIGH signal
2. **Ultrasonic burst**: 8 cycles of 40kHz sound
3. **Echo detection**: Measures time for sound to return
4. **Distance calculation**: Distance = (time × speed_of_sound) / 2

## Troubleshooting

### No readings or erratic values:
- Check wiring connections
- Ensure 5V power supply
- Verify trigger and echo pins
- Clear obstacles from sensor path

### Always shows maximum distance:
- Check echo pin connection
- Verify sensor orientation
- Ensure no electrical interference
- Try different sensor if available

### LED/Buzzer not working:
- Check LED polarity (long leg = positive)
- Verify resistor value (220Ω)
- Test with simple blink sketch
- Check buzzer connections

### LCD not displaying:
- Follow LCD troubleshooting from Program 8
- Verify all LCD connections
- Adjust contrast potentiometer

## Sensor Specifications

### HC-SR04 Specifications:
- **Operating Voltage**: 5V DC
- **Operating Current**: 15mA
- **Measuring Range**: 2cm to 400cm
- **Accuracy**: ±3mm
- **Measuring Angle**: 30°
- **Trigger Pulse**: 10µs TTL pulse
- **Echo Pulse**: Proportional to distance

### Important Notes:
- **Minimum distance**: 2cm (closer objects may not be detected)
- **Maximum distance**: 400cm (4 meters)
- **Beam angle**: 30° cone
- **Surface dependency**: Hard, flat surfaces reflect better
- **Temperature effect**: Sound speed varies with temperature

## Advanced Modifications

### 1. Temperature Compensation:
```cpp
float speedOfSound = 331.4 + (0.6 * temperature);  // m/s
float distance = (duration * speedOfSound) / 20000;
```

### 2. Multiple Sensors:
```cpp
const int NUM_SENSORS = 3;
int trigPins[NUM_SENSORS] = {7, 9, 11};
int echoPins[NUM_SENSORS] = {8, 10, 12};
```

### 3. Distance-Based LED Brightness:
```cpp
int brightness = map(constrain(distance, 0, 50), 0, 50, 255, 0);
analogWrite(LED_PIN, brightness);
```

### 4. Motion Detection:
```cpp
static float lastDistance = 0;
if (abs(distance - lastDistance) > 5) {
  Serial.println("Motion detected!");
}
lastDistance = distance;
```

### 5. Data Logging:
```cpp
void logDistance() {
  Serial.print(millis());
  Serial.print(",");
  Serial.println(distance);
}
```
