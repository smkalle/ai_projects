## Why Taipy for AI Engineers

- **Single-file power** – A declarative GUI layer plus a graph-based pipeline engine means one Python script can handle both ETL logic *and* the front end—no HTML or JavaScript needed.  
- **Scenario objects (v3.0)** – Named, versioned pipeline runs let business users replay “what-if” experiments and share results.  
- **Faster to ship** – Core-team benchmarks show **30-40 % less development time** on large dashboards versus Flask + JS or Streamlit glue code.  
- **Scales to millions of rows** – Community tests report lower latency on 1 M +-row datasets thanks to Taipy’s asynchronous data-flow model.
