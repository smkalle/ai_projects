# AI Competency Gradation by Role

| Role | Unacceptable | Capable | Adaptive | Transformative |
|------|-------------|---------|----------|----------------|
| **Engineering** | Can't AI coding assistants too risky, Has never tested AI-generated code, Relies only on Stack Overflow advice | Uses ChatGPT/Copilot/etc for simple coding tasks (eg: regex, port test setup), Can explain how they prompt, review, and validate AI output | Chains LLM calls with feedback + very logic, Adds AI to existing development workflows, Knows Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc, Reviews AI-generated code for security, Debug, token limits, code review, etc | Ships LLM-powered features, machines live metrics, and refines based on user feedback, Builds an AI-first dev pipeline (specifically: RAG docs, any ship uses down full cycle time |
| **Product** | Dismisses AI as hype, showing no curiosity about user value, Discourages team from any AI concepts or experiments | Uses ChatGPT to draft PRDs, story maps, and synthesize user interview notes, Knows basics (LLMs, embeddings, latency vs. cost) and can share example prompt patterns | Chooses models based on accuracy, latency, throughput, and context-window constraints, Demonstrates ROI (eg: cut time-to-insight from 5 days down to 3) | Builds/drives product strategy & org-wide AI roadmap through value-first product development, Launches a proprietary fine-tuned LLM feature that opens up a new pricing tier |
| **Support** | Refuses to use AI for support workflows, Has no curiosity about the roles, metrics, tools, etc., Manually handles every ticket | Summarizes tickets with ChatGPT and cites their context internally, Knows and follows Security / TSG approval flow before trying new tools | Builds Zapier workflows that triage queues and auto-tag Clin records, Tracks CX metrics, refines prompts when AI misses slack, keeps living doc of what works | Built out an org-wide AI triage bot that cuts first-response time by 30%, Creates & presents ROI dashboards, balancing cost vs. customer experience at scale |
| **People / HR** | Dismisses all AI hiring tools, Prohibits both internal networks, Relies on manual scheduling and candidate follow-ups | Drafts interview guides & summarizes panels (using AI summary, saving 1-2hrs hours/week), Can explain privacy limits (eg: no PII in public models) | Automates onboarding docs; uses LLM requests/screen-shots-tagging, yielding time savings, Measures time-to-hire gains and refines prompts for under-represented talent pools | Revamps recruiting funnel with AI to shorten time-to-hire by 30%, Trains HRBPs on safe AI and shapes company policy on ethical hiring AI |
| **Marketing** | Runs campaigns without AI-driven A/B tests or content ideation, Ignores AI tools for analytics, personalization, or audience insights | Uses AI to summarize customer stories, Drafts first drafts of social posts and headlines with AI, then edits by hand | Built a basic AI slack and A/B-tests copy to increase CTR by 30%, Audits brand language and optimizes prompt libraries | Builds an AI-driven campaign engine to personalize content at scale, Leads quarterly AI trainings, sets tooling roadmap, and speaks at industry events on AI-powered growth |
