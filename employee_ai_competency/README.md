```

## Usage

### Taking the Assessment

1. **Launch the application** using one of the installation methods above
2. **Select your role** from the available options
3. **Answer 5 questions** about your AI usage and experience
4. **View your results** with personalized recommendations
5. **Share or retake** the assessment as needed

### Understanding Your Results

Your competency level will be one of:

- **üü° Foundational (0-25%)**: Just starting your AI journey
- **üü† Developing (26-50%)**: Building AI skills and experience
- **üü¢ Proficient (51-75%)**: Advanced AI integration in daily work
- **üîµ Advanced (76-100%)**: Leading AI innovation and transformation

## How It Works

### 1. Role Selection
Choose from 5 professional roles:
- **üíª Engineering**: Development & Technical
- **üöÄ Product**: Strategy & Innovation
- **üéß Support**: Customer Experience
- **üë• People/HR**: Human Resources
- **üìà Marketing**: Growth & Engagement

### 2. Assessment Questions
Answer 5 role-specific behavioral questions:
- Questions focus on frequency, integration, and impact of AI usage
- Neutral language without bias toward any competency level
- Auto-advance to next question after selection
- Back navigation available to review/change answers

### 3. Results & Insights
Receive your competency level with personalized recommendations:
- **Foundational** (0-25%): Basic awareness, limited experience
- **Developing** (26-50%): Regular basic usage, growing skills
- **Proficient** (51-75%): Advanced integration, measurable impact
- **Advanced** (76-100%): Expert level, driving innovation

### Architecture

The assessment follows a three-step process:

### Code Quality

- **No Dependencies**: Pure vanilla implementation for maximum performance
- **Modular Design**: Separated concerns for easy maintenance
- **Modern JavaScript**: ES6+ features with fallbacks
- **CSS Variables**: Easy theming and customization
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper structure for accessibility

### Assessment Methodology

Our assessment methodology is based on:

1. **Behavioral Indicators**: Questions focus on what you do, not what you know
2. **Progressive Complexity**: Each answer option represents increasing AI sophistication
3. **Role Relevance**: Questions tailored to actual job responsibilities
4. **Objective Scoring**: No bias in question wording, clear scoring criteria

## Customization

### Adding New Roles
Edit `script.js` and add to the `roleQuestions` object:
```javascript
'NewRole': [
    {
        id: 'question_id',
        question: 'Your question here?',
        options: [
            { text: 'Option 1', score: 0 },
            { text: 'Option 2', score: 1 },
            // ... more options
        ]
    },
    // ... more questions
]
```

### Modifying Competency Levels
Edit the `competencyLevels` object in `script.js` to adjust:
- Score ranges
- Level names
- Descriptions
- Recommendations

### Styling Changes
Modify `styles.css` to customize:
- Colors: Update gradient colors and accent colors
- Fonts: Change font family or sizes
- Animations: Adjust transition timings
- Layout: Modify spacing and component sizes
