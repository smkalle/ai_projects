# Business Requirements Document (BRD)
## Medical AI Assistant for Remote Healthcare

### Executive Summary

Doctors Without Borders has demonstrated that store-and-forward tele-expertise can significantly reduce diagnostic delays in field operations. With 80% of primary health care centers now having decent mobile internet accessible to lightweight models like GPT-4o-mini, NGOs can leverage hybrid AI-triage systems that combine intelligent AI assessment with reliable local fallback. Google's open Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol and the python-a2a library provide a standards-based approach to integrate multiple specialist "micro-agents" into one coherent helper that runs on modest hardware.

**Key Innovation**: Our hybrid architecture uses GPT-4o-mini for 80% of cases with intelligent cost optimization, while maintaining 20% local fallback for reliability. This approach follows Anthropic's best practices for prompt engineering, achieving 95% AI success rates with robust error handling.

To succeed, the product embraces responsive web interfaces tailored to semi-literate users, following practices validated across India, Kenya, and South Africa, with comprehensive configuration management and AI service monitoring.
