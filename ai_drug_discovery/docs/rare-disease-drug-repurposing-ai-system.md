## üöÄ Vision

Accelerating drug repurposing for rare diseases through AI-powered biomedical knowledge discovery, leveraging LangChain's integration with Claude models and citable search results to build trustworthy, verifiable AI systems where hallucinations can be life-threatening.

## üìä Impact Potential

- **Target Population**: ~300 million people worldwide affected by rare diseases
- **Current Treatment Gap**: <6% of rare diseases have approved treatments
- **Traditional Timeline**: 10-15 years for new drug development
- **Our Goal**: Reduce discovery timelines from years to weeks with cited evidence

## üéØ Key Features

### üî¨ **AI-Powered Drug Discovery**
- Multi-agent system with specialized LLM agents for different research tasks
- Integration with 15+ biomedical databases (PubMed, DrugBank, PubChem, WHO, CDC)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with mandatory citations for medical safety

### üß¨ **Rare Disease Focus**
- Specialized knowledge base for rare genetic disorders
- Patient symptom analysis and genetic data integration
- Drug interaction and safety profile analysis

### üìö **Citable Evidence System**
- Every recommendation linked to peer-reviewed sources
- Real-time access to latest clinical trials and research
- Transparent AI reasoning with source attribution

### üîß **Extensible Architecture**
- Modular design for easy addition of new databases
- RESTful API for integration with existing healthcare systems
- Support for custom rare disease ontologies

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- OpenAI API key or Claude API access
- 16GB+ RAM recommended

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/rare-disease-drug-repurposing-ai
cd rare-disease-drug-repurposing-ai

# Set up Python environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r config/requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# Start the system
docker-compose up -d

# Run data ingestion
python scripts/data_ingestion.py

# Start the API server
python src/api/main.py
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from src.core.models import RareDiseaseDrugRepurposing

# Initialize the system
system = RareDiseaseDrugRepurposing()

# Query for drug repurposing opportunities
result = system.analyze_disease(
    disease_name="Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome",
    symptoms=["accelerated aging", "cardiovascular complications"],
    genetic_markers=["LMNA mutations"]
)

# Access results with citations
print(result.recommendations)  # Drug candidates
print(result.evidence)         # Supporting research
print(result.citations)       # Source references
```

## üìã Use Cases

### 1. **Drug Repurposing Discovery**
- Input: Rare disease symptoms and genetic data
- Output: Ranked list of existing drugs with repurposing potential
- Evidence: Peer-reviewed citations for each recommendation

### 2. **Clinical Trial Matching**
- Input: Patient profile and condition
- Output: Relevant ongoing clinical trials
- Evidence: Trial registry data and eligibility criteria

### 3. **Mechanism of Action Analysis**
- Input: Drug compound and target disease
- Output: Biological pathway analysis
- Evidence: Molecular interaction databases

### 4. **Safety Profile Assessment**
- Input: Drug candidate and patient characteristics
- Output: Risk assessment and contraindications
- Evidence: Adverse event databases and case studies

## üî¨ Core Components
