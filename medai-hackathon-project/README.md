## üéØ Problem Statement

In remote and underserved communities worldwide, access to qualified medical professionals is limited. NGOs working in these areas need AI-powered tools that can:

- Provide preliminary diagnostic insights from medical images and patient descriptions
- Support triage decisions in resource-constrained environments  
- Assist healthcare workers with limited medical training
- Work reliably in low-connectivity environments

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üß† **Multimodal Medical AI**
- **Image + Text Analysis**: Upload medical images (X-rays, CT scans, wound photos) with patient symptoms
- **Step-by-step Reasoning**: AI provides transparent, interpretable diagnostic reasoning
- **Confidence Scoring**: Clear uncertainty quantification for each assessment

### üí¨ **Medical Chat Assistant**  
- Context-aware medical Q&A system
- Pre-loaded common scenarios for NGO healthcare workers
- Emergency triage guidance and protocols

### üì± **NGO-Optimized Interface**
- Mobile-responsive design for field use
- Offline-capable Progressive Web App (PWA)
- Multi-language support for international deployment

### üõ°Ô∏è **Ethics-First Design**
- Prominent medical disclaimers and safety warnings
- Privacy-preserving data handling
- Clear escalation paths to human medical professionals
- Compliance with medical ethics guidelines

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker Setup (Recommended for Hackathons)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/medai-hackathon-project.git
cd medai-hackathon-project

# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build

# Access the application at http://localhost:8000
```

### Option 2: Local Development

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/your-username/medai-hackathon-project.git
cd medai-hackathon-project

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv medai-env
source medai-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: medai-env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Setup environment variables
cp config/.env.example config/.env
# Edit config/.env with your API keys

# Run the application
python src/main.py
```

### Option 3: Gradio Demo (Fastest for Prototyping)

```bash
# Install gradio version
pip install -r requirements-gradio.txt

# Run Gradio demo
python src/gradio_demo.py

# Access at http://localhost:7860
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create `config/.env` from the template:

```bash
# OpenAI API (for GPT-4o vision)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o

# Hugging Face (for local models)
HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN=your_hf_token_here

# Application settings
DEBUG=true
LOG_LEVEL=info
MAX_FILE_SIZE=10MB

# Security
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:8000
```

## üè• Medical Use Cases

### 1. Chest X-ray Analysis
```python
# Example usage for pneumonia detection
analyzer = MedicalAIAnalyzer(config)
result = analyzer.analyze(
    image="chest_xray.jpg",
    symptoms="Persistent cough, fever, difficulty breathing for 3 days",
    patient_history="45-year-old, smoker, no previous lung issues"
)

print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']:.1%}")
print(f"Key Finding: {result['findings'][0]}")
# Output: "Confidence: 78%, Key Finding: Bilateral infiltrates suggest possible pneumonia"
```

### 2. Emergency Triage
```python
# Rapid triage decision support
triage_result = analyzer.triage_assessment(
    symptoms="Severe chest pain, left arm numbness, profuse sweating",
    vital_signs={"bp": "180/110", "pulse": "120", "temp": "98.6"}
)

print(f"Priority Level: {triage_result['priority']}")
print(f"Recommended Action: {triage_result['action']}")
# Output: "Priority Level: EMERGENCY, Recommended Action: Immediate transport"
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Medical Ethics & Compliance

### Key Principles
1. **Patient Safety First**: Never replace professional medical judgment
2. **Transparency**: Clear explanations of AI limitations and reasoning
3. **Privacy Protection**: HIPAA/GDPR compliant data handling
4. **Bias Mitigation**: Regular testing for demographic bias in recommendations
5. **Human Oversight**: Always provide escalation paths to medical professionals

## üìä Model Performance
