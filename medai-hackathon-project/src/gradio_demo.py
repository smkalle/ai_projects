                ### Setup and Usage Guide

                #### Quick Start:
                1. **Medical Analysis**: Upload image + describe symptoms
                2. **Review Results**: Check reasoning, findings, recommendations  
                3. **Chat Assistant**: Ask medical questions for guidance
                4. **Always**: Consult medical professionals for final decisions

                #### API Keys Setup:
                - Copy `config/.env.example` to `config/.env`

                - For local deployment, see README.md

                #### Medical Use Cases:
                - **Pneumonia Detection**: Chest X-ray + respiratory symptoms
                - **Emergency Triage**: Rapid patient prioritization  
                - **Wound Assessment**: Infection risk evaluation
                - **General Consultation**: Medical guidance for NGO workers

                #### Ethical Guidelines:
                - ‚úÖ Use for preliminary assessment and education
                - ‚úÖ Always provide medical disclaimers
                - ‚úÖ Ensure patient privacy and consent
                - ‚ùå Never replace professional medical judgment
                - ‚ùå Avoid use in life-threatening emergencies without backup
